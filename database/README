This database gathers configuration files to help you setup your
laptop under Linux.

The tree follows this scheme:
 BRAND/LAPTOP_MODEL/SOFTWARE-VERSION/CONFIGURATION_FILE

You can then either copy the file to your local computer and use it directly
or you can clone the whole repository and install a symbolic link to easily
merge the update with your local changes.

CAUTION:
* You *have* to know the software you want to configure. The provided
  configuration file may *not* work directly on your hardware.
* A non-working configuration file can crash your computer, *always* make
  a backup of your current configuration file before updating it.
* Shell scripts (and some configuration files) can damage your computer,
  always read the configuration file you will be using before installing
  them locally.

This project does *not* provide software support. If you need assistance,
please use the project's mailing-lists.
